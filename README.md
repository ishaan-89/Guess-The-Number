A simple and fun number guessing game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was created as my **first JavaScript project** to practice DOM manipulation and game logic.

You start with a score of 20, and each wrong guess reduces your score.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Enter a number between 1 and 20.
2. Click **Check**.
3. The game tells you if the guess is too high or too low.
4. Guess correctly before your score reaches zero.
5. Click **Again** to restart the game.
